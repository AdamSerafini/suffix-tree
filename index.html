<h1>Ukkonen's Algorithm: a visual, interactive guide.</h1>
<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
<p>
Suffix Trees solve a problem in Computer Science called "String Matching": given
a string S with length n, in what positions (if any) can the pattern P with
length m (where m <= n) be found?
</p>
<p>
The naive approach takes in the worst case O(nm). Suffix Trees speed up the
search to O(m) with a one time cost of O(n) for the initial tree construction.
That's ideal for situations where you need to repeatedly search for small
patterns in a much larger string.
</p>
<p>
Ukkonen's algorithm is one of three known algorithms for constructing suffix
trees in linear time. What follows is a description of how the algorithm works,
adapted from my MSc thesis which was in turn based on Gusfield's explantion in
Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences.
